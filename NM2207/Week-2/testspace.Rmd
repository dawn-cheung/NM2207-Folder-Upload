## R Markdown



```{r starwars, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data=starwars) + #the + is to superimpose the aesthetics layer over the data layer
  aes(x = height, y = mass) +#aes is aesthetics
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Height/cm",
       y = "Mass/kg",
       title = "mASS VS HEIGHT",
       caption = "look at my sexy graph")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
