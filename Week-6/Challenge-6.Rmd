## Questions

#### Question-1: Countdown Blastoff (While Loop)

Create a program that simulates a rocket launch countdown using a while loop. Start from 10 and countdown to "Blastoff!" with a one-second delay between each countdown number. Print a message when the rocket launches.

**Hint:** You may want to use `cat` command to print the countdown and `Sys.sleep` for incorporating the delay

**Output preview:** Here is how the countdown could look like 

```{r, eval=FALSE, out.height= "20px",out.width= "200px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/countdown.png") #WHAT IS THIS
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, out.height= "20px",out.width= "200px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/blastoff.png")
```

**Solutions:**

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
count <- 10
while (count > 0) { #does not include 0
  cat( "...", count) #cat prints multiple variables, less complicated than sprintf()
  count = count - 1
  Sys.sleep(1)
}
print("Blastoff!!!")
```

#### Question-2: Word Reverser (for Loop)

Develop a program that takes a user-entered word and uses a while loop to print the word's characters in reverse order. For example, if the user enters "hello," the program should print "olleh."

**Hint:** You may want to use `substr` command to access each character of the input word, and `paste` command to join the reversed letters one at a time

**Solutions:** 

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
input_str <- "tired"
for 
```
